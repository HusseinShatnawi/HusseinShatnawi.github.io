		<p class="text">I am pleased to present the culmination of my work, aligning precisely with the business
			requirements set
			forth by the CEO, David. In response to the ever-evolving nature of business, our simulated company
			embarked
			on a mission to bolster the sales tracking and analysis capabilities. Through diligent efforts and a
			commitment to David's vision, I have successfully created an Interactive Sales Dashboard. This tool
			empowers us to make data-driven decisions, track performance against budget, and optimize the internet
			sales
			reports. The dashboard serves as a pivotal asset, supporting the quest to enhance sales strategies and
			gain
			deeper insights into the market dynamics.</p>

			<h2>Project Objectives:</h2>
			<p class="text">Our project was meticulously executed to meet three core objectives as stipulated by David:
			</p>
			<p class="text"><strong>Enhanced Sales Tracking: </strong>To deliver an expansive view of our sales
				performance by offering a comprehensive overview of product sales, client identification, and the
				ability to track sales trends over time.</p>
			<p class="text"><strong>Customizable Filters: </strong>To cater to the unique needs of our sales team,
				allowing them to filter and dissect sales efforts based on the products they manage and the customers
				they serve.</p>
			<p class="text"><strong>Budget Comparison: </strong>To facilitate an evaluation of our sales performance
				against pre-defined budgets spanning from 2020 to 2022, and to enable comparisons with historical data
				from the previous three years.</p>
			<h2>Key Features of the Interactive Sales Dashboard:</h2>
			<p class="text">The Interactive Sales Dashboard, crafted in alignment with David's business requirements,
				incorporates several pivotal features to streamline our sales analysis process:</p>
			<p class="text"><strong>Product Sales Tracking: </strong>The dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of the
				sales volume for each product. This data is instrumental in identifying top-performing products and
				optimizing inventory management.</p>
			<p class="text"><strong>Customer Analysis: </strong>By offering insights into our customer base, the
				dashboard enables tailored sales and marketing strategies to meet the diverse needs and preferences of
				our client segments.</p>
			<p class="text"><strong>Time-Based Analysis: </strong>The dashboard includes a time-series analysis
				component, facilitating the tracking of sales performance over time. This feature assists in identifying
				seasonal trends, evaluating the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, and making proactive adjustments
				to our sales strategy.</p>
			<p class="text"><strong>Customizable Filters: </strong>Sales representatives can personalize their
				dashboards, leveraging filters based on the products they handle and the clients they serve. This
				customization promotes a more focused and efficient sales approach.</p>
			<p class="text"><strong>Budget Comparison: </strong>The dashboard seamlessly integrates budget data from
				2020, 2021, and 2022, simplifying the process of comparing actual sales performance against predefined
				targets. This feature provides valuable insights into our progress and highlights areas that require
				attention.</p>
			<h2>Benefits of the Interactive Sales Dashboard:</h2>
			<p class="text">The implementation of this dashboard delivers several substantial benefits to our
				organization:</p>
			<p class="text"><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making: </strong>With real-time access to detailed sales data,
				our team can make informed decisions to optimize product offerings, target specific customer segments,
				and enhance overall sales strategies.</p>
			<p class="text"><strong>Efficiency: </strong>Customizable filters empower sales representatives to focus on
				their areas of expertise, resulting in more efficient and effective sales efforts.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="text">I received an email from the CEO that outlined the challenges the marketing department was
				facing. Based on this email, I created user stories to define the features and functionality of the
				project, which will be used to create a roadmap and ensure that it meets the needs of the users and the
				business requirements. Below is a table of the user stories:</p>
			<div class="email">
				<p>Dear Hussein,</p>
				<p>I am writing to propose the implementation of a Sales Analysis Dashboard project, aimed
					at enhancing our decision-making capabilities and optimizing sales strategies. This project
					comprises two interconnected dashboards:</p>
				<p><strong>Sales Performance Dashboard: </strong>Providing insights into sales trends, top
					customers, budget comparisons, and product analysis.</p>
				<p><strong>Customer Demographics Dashboard: </strong>Offering valuable data on customer
					demographics, including city data, gender, status, family, and professions.</p>
				<p><strong>Project Goals: </strong></p>

					Under the visionary leadership of CEO David, I have successfully developed two robust data-driven
					dashboards, meticulously tailored to enhance our sales analysis capabilities. These dashboards
					empower us with comprehensive insights into the selling process, facilitating data-informed
					decision-making and strategic optimization.
				</p>
				<h2>SQL queries:</h2>
				<p class="text">During the second project phase, I strategically utilized the CRM dataset, thoughtfully
					provided by Microsoft, as the cornerstone of our analytical efforts. This dataset served as a rich
					source of data for exploration. Leveraging my expertise in database management, I meticulously
					collected and refined this dataset using SQL Server Management Studio. <br>To illustrate, here are
					some <strong>pivotal SQL queries</strong> that played a central role in our data collection and
					preparation:</p>
				<p class="text">
					<strong>Data Extraction: </strong><br>I crafted SQL queries to extract relevant information from the
					CRM dataset.
				</p>
				<p class="text">
					<strong>Data Transformation: </strong><br>I applied SQL transformations to aggregate and format the
					data.
				</p>
				<p class="text">
					<strong>Data Joining: </strong><br>I utilized SQL joins to merge data from different tables.
				</p>

				<p class="text">This project phase underscored my proficiency in database management, SQL query
					development, and data preparation. These skills were instrumental in transforming raw data into the
					foundation for our successful sales analysis dashboard, facilitating actionable insights.</p>

				<h2>Customer Demographics Dashboard:</h2>
				<p class="text">This second dashboard unveils valuable insights into our client base. It features an
					interactive city map, gender and status pie charts, details on the number of children and car
					ownership, and a comprehensive view of our customers' professions.</p>
				<p class="text">Both dashboards are fortified with versatile slicers, enabling effortless data filtering
					by year, month, product category, customer city, and sub-category. This dynamic feature empowers
					users to tailor their analyses, gaining deeper insights into specific aspects of our business.</p>
